# Changelog

## v0.8.12.8 (2026-04-19)

### Breaking Changes — filter v4.1.0, preview-mode surface narrowed
- **`PREVIEW_MODE="artifact"` and `PREVIEW_MODE="both"` removed** (closes #43). `outlet()` no longer emits a fenced ```html `<iframe>` block — it only appends a markdown preview link. The extra html block was redundant *and* actively harmful: the `fix_preview_url_detection` frontend patch is guarded by `!htmlGroups.some(o=>o.html)`, so pre-emitting an html block from the filter caused the patch to skip detection, leaving the iframe rendered as a raw code fence in chat (the #43 symptom that had been reappearing since v3.2.0). Only `"button"` and `"off"` remain; `"button"` is the new default. Matches Alfa prod v3.8.0 behaviour — the long-standing production reference was never using artifact mode to begin with.
- **Migration**: saved `"artifact"` / `"both"` values now fail Pydantic validation on load. Re-seed Valves with `rm /app/backend/data/.computer-use-initialized` + container restart. `init.sh` will write the new `"button"` default.

### Breaking Changes — single public URL on the server
- **Server env renamed**: `FILE_SERVER_URL` → `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. It's now the *single source of truth* for the browser-facing URL — baked into `/system-prompt` text and returned to the Open WebUI filter via the new `X-Public-Base-URL` response header. Rename in your `.env`.
- **Tool Valve renamed**: `FILE_SERVER_URL` → `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` (same semantics — internal URL for MCP forwarding).
- **Filter Valves changed**: `FILE_SERVER_URL` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_URL` Valves *removed*. Replaced with a single `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` Valve (internal URL for server→server fetch). The filter reads the public URL from the server's response header — no more "two `FILE_SERVER_URL` settings that must match" footgun.
- **Filter `_fetch_system_prompt()` signature**: now returns `tuple[public_url, prompt] | None` instead of `str | None`. `outlet()` reads `public_url` from the cache.
- **`DOCKER_AI_UPLOAD_URL` env var renamed**: → `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` (consistent with the Valves).
- **`docker-compose.webui.yml`**: dropped `MCP_SERVER_EXTERNAL_URL` and `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway`. The open-webui and computer-use-server containers now talk over the shared Compose default network using Docker service DNS (`http://computer-use-server:8081`).

**Migration:**
1. Rename `FILE_SERVER_URL=...` → `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=...` in your `.env`.
2. If you run `docker-compose.webui.yml` / `init.sh`: the init script re-seeds Valves with the new names automatically — delete `/app/backend/data/.computer-use-initialized` and restart `open-webui` so it re-runs.
3. If you configured Valves manually in the Open WebUI admin UI, re-enter them: tool `ORCHESTRATOR_URL`, filter `ORCHESTRATOR_URL`. The old `FILE_SERVER_URL` / `SYSTEM_PROMPT_URL` entries in the DB are ignored by the new Pydantic model and can be left in place.

### Features
- **Filter v3.2.0 → v3.4.0 — simpler Valves**: the three boolean preview/archive Valves (`ENABLE_PREVIEW_ARTIFACT`, `ENABLE_PREVIEW_BUTTON`, `ENABLE_ARCHIVE_BUTTON`) were first collapsed in v3.3.0 into two Literal Valves (`PREVIEW_MODE` ∈ `artifact | button | both | off`, `ARCHIVE_BUTTON` ∈ `on | off`), then removed entirely in v3.4.0 along with their `@model_validator` bridge. Users upgrading straight from v3.2.0 revert to defaults — upgrade via v3.3.0 first if you need to preserve saved preferences.
- **Filter v4.0.0 — public URL owned by server**: the filter no longer carries a public-URL Valve. The server's new `/system-prompt` response header `X-Public-Base-URL` delivers it to the filter per request; `_fetch_system_prompt()` caches the (public_url, prompt) pair so `outlet()` can decorate with browser-facing preview/archive links without its own Valve.
- **Startup warning for default `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`** (closes #59): the orchestrator logs a one-time warning when the env var is still the hardcoded internal-DNS default (`http://computer-use-server:8081`), catching the #43-class "preview panel never appears" misconfiguration at boot rather than silently in production.

### Fixes
- **Filter — browser-only sessions got no preview**: `outlet()` previously required a `/files/{chat_id}/…` URL in the assistant message to inject preview decorations, so pure browser sessions (playwright / chromium with no downloadable file) saw nothing. Detection now also fires on a `<details type="tool_calls">` block that references a browser tool. Scoped to the tag — free-text keyword mentions never false-trigger. Archive button stays gated on file URLs (unchanged).
- **sub-agent `max_turns` default inconsistency**: the Open WebUI tool's `sub_agent(max_turns=...)` signature defaulted to 50, silently overriding the server's 25 default on every call. Unified to 25 alongside a sweep of stale doc references (docs/SKILLS.md, skills/public/sub-agent/references/usage.md).

### Tests
- **Filter — `BrowserToolTrigger` class** (10 tests): exercises the new browser-tool trigger — every keyword, html-escaped `arguments="…"` (production delivery form), free-text scoping, non-tool_calls `<details>` blocks, empty content, preview-button injection, archive button still gated on files, invariant that no fenced-html or raw iframe is ever emitted, idempotency across repeated `outlet()` calls.
- **Filter — legacy-value guard**: `test_legacy_preview_mode_values_rejected_on_construction` asserts that saved `"artifact"` / `"both"` Valve values from v3.x / v4.0.0 DBs fail Pydantic validation loudly instead of silently falling through.
- **Server — `test_startup_warnings.py`** (3 tests): env unset → warn; custom URL → silent; explicit default literal → warn.

### Documentation
- `docs/openwebui-filter.md`: Valves reference updated for v3.4.0 (legacy rows removed), "Preview UX: which PREVIEW_MODE fits you?" retained.
- `openwebui/functions/README.md` Valve table refreshed.
- `openwebui/init.sh` bootstrap payload updated to new schema field names so fresh deployments start with new names in the DB.

### Features — maximum MCP-native system-prompt surface (six tiers)

The same per-session system prompt is now delivered through six channels backed by a single cached renderer (`computer-use-server/system_prompt.py::render_system_prompt`, 60s TTL per `(chat_id, user_email)`). Redundancy is by design — a client may skip any one channel and still get the prompt somewhere. Complete map at `docs/system-prompt.md`.

1. **Tool descriptions** — `bash_tool` + `view` docstrings point at `/home/assistant/README.md` as a recovery hint (`tools/list` surface).
2. **`/home/assistant/README.md` in sandbox** — rendered on container creation via `container.put_archive`, survives container removals via the `chat-{chat_id}-workspace` volume.
3. **Static `InitializeResult.instructions=` hint** — one-liner pointing at README + `resources/list` for clients that render the initialize-result field directly.
4. **Dynamic `InitializeResult.instructions`** — per-request content via `current_instructions` ContextVar + `_DynamicInstructionsServer` subclass swapped onto `mcp._mcp_server`. Works thanks to `stateless_http=True` + per-request `create_initialization_options()`.
5. **`resources/list` + `resources/read`** — uploaded files surfaced as `FunctionResource` per chat, URI shape `file://uploads/{chat_id}/{url-encoded rel_path}`. Registered on container creation AND on `POST /api/uploads` so new uploads appear without client reconnect. Upload itself stays on HTTP (MCP has no upload primitive).
6. **`GET /system-prompt` HTTP endpoint** — backward compat for the Open WebUI filter. Now reads `X-Chat-Id` / `X-User-Email` (plus `X-OpenWebUI-*` aliases) with header priority over query params; delegates to the shared renderer; `X-Public-Base-URL` response header preserved.

All four "dynamic" tiers (2, 4, 5, 6) hit the same `render_system_prompt` cache — one render per `(chat_id, user_email)` per minute regardless of fan-out.

**Deliberately NOT using `@mcp.prompt("system")`.** We considered exposing the prompt via the MCP `prompts/*` primitive (OpenAI Agents SDK's documented fallback `server.get_prompt(...)`), but the 2025-11-25 spec restricts `PromptMessage.role` to `{user, assistant}` and positions prompts as user-controlled slash commands. Naming a prompt `"system"` clashes with both, and `InitializeResult.instructions` is the canonical field for server-supplied instructions. Tier 4 covers that canonically — a `prompts/get("system")` entry would have been off-spec duplication.

Duplication analysis (per-scenario): Open WebUI through LiteLLM sees the prompt **once** via the filter's `inlet()` inject — `InitializeResult.instructions` is not forwarded by LiteLLM. MCP-native clients (Agents SDK, Inspector, Claude Desktop) see it **once** via `InitializeResult.instructions`. In both paths a second copy appears only if the model follows the Tier 1 recovery-nudge and calls `view /home/assistant/README.md`. Worst case: 2 copies; typical case: 1. The nudge stays to help pathological clients that strip system prompts — see `docs/system-prompt.md` for tightening options.

Private-API touchpoints are pinned by tests (`tests/orchestrator/test_dynamic_instructions.py`, `test_mcp_resources.py`) and documented at their call sites with SDK line references; when bumping `mcp` minor, re-run these tests first.

### Reliability — post-review hardening (PR #65 follow-ups)

After independent review of the six-tier surface a series of regression and
silent-failure fixes landed. Each one closed a real path that was broken in
production *or* in the upgrade story:

- **`/mcp` returned HTTP 500 in production builds**. Dockerfile didn't `COPY` `mcp_resources.py` and `uploads.py`, the lifespan caught the resulting `ImportError` and yielded WITHOUT calling `session_manager.run()`, and from then on every MCP call hit `Task group is not initialized`. uvicorn's default error path returned a body-less 500 with no traceback — the failure was 100% silent server-side and surfaced only as empty tool output in the chat. Three changes prevent recurrence:
  - `Dockerfile` now copies the missing modules.
  - Lifespan no longer swallows `ImportError` — boot crashes loud if anything required is missing, with the matching dead `try/except` in `_init_mcp()` and the module-level `get_mcp_app` import removed for a single failure mode.
  - New CI job `Smoke — POST /mcp returns 200` builds the server image, boots it, and POSTs an `initialize` request. Catches this exact regression in one run.
- **Open WebUI tool now classifies every failure mode loudly**. `openwebui/tools/computer_use_tools.py` previously returned `"[No output]"` on empty results and a single `"[Error] MCP call failed"` for any exception, often without firing the `status="error"` SSE event — the chat tool-call collapsible looked green and empty, and the AI concluded the tool was broken. New behaviour:
  - Pre-flight probes both `GET /health` AND `POST /mcp initialize` (the second is what catches the silent 500 above). 30s cache, 3s timeout.
  - Tiered exception classes: `[CONFIG ERROR]`, `[NETWORK ERROR]`, `[MCP TRANSPORT ERROR]`, `[UNEXPECTED ERROR]`, `[TOOL ERROR]`.
  - Empty-result disambiguation: `"[Command produced no output. Exit was successful — this is not an error.]"` instead of `"[No output]"`. Phrasing is deliberate — AI models read the string literally.
  - `Tools._run_tool` consolidates the five per-tool wrappers; `_looks_like_error()` replaces five drifted heuristics so `view`/`str_replace`/`create_file` now report errors with the same fidelity as `bash_tool`.
- **Filter `outlet()` no longer drops preview/archive buttons silently** when the inlet cache is cold (Open WebUI restart between inlet and outlet). It re-fetches `/system-prompt` to recover the public URL — same `_fetch_system_prompt` stale-cache fallback path, so a truly down server still skips decoration ("broken links worse than no links" invariant preserved).
- **`/system-prompt` legacy n8n contract restored**. PR #65 had auto-substituted `chat_id="default"` when no chat_id was supplied; now it returns the template with `{file_base_url}` / `{archive_url}` / `{chat_id}` placeholders intact when nothing is supplied, matching pre-v4.0.0 behaviour for external integrators that do their own substitution.
- **Per-`(chat_id, user_email)` render lock**. Slow `skill_manager` providers no longer serialize all MCP requests across all chats — only the matching key blocks.
- **Atomic resource sync window**. `mcp_resources.sync_chat_resources` builds the new resource set outside the lock and swaps in one synchronous critical section; `asyncio.Lock` swapped to `threading.Lock` so the worker-thread `asyncio.run()` path actually serializes against the request-loop path.
- **Defensive shape assertions** on `mcp._mcp_server` and the lowlevel `Server` before the Tier 4 class swap. SDK rename now fails at import with a pointer to re-pin, instead of silently dropping Tier 4 to static instructions.
- **`mcp` SDK pinned** to `1.27.0` with a comment listing the three private-API touchpoints the pin guards.
- **`docker_manager.put_archive` checked** for `False` return — README write failures surface as exceptions instead of false-success log lines.
- **Sanitization at boundaries**: `sync_chat_resources(chat_id)` calls `sanitize_chat_id` so case variants (`"Chat"` vs `"chat"`) share the same stale-uri set; `/system-prompt` does the same on header/query chat_id.

### CI

- New job `Pytest — orchestrator` runs `pytest tests/orchestrator/` (97 tests) on every push. Existed in repo, never wired to CI.
- New job `Smoke — POST /mcp returns 200` boots the server image and runs `tests/test-mcp-endpoint-live.sh` — the smoke that would have caught the silent 500 bug in one CI run.

### Dependencies
- `claude-code` pinned to `2.1.114` in the sandbox `Dockerfile` for reproducible builds. `latest` still available as an override.
- `mcp` Python SDK pinned to `1.27.0` in `computer-use-server/requirements.txt` (was `>=1.0.0`). Required because the orchestrator uses three private attributes (`mcp._mcp_server`, `mcp._resource_manager._resources`, `mcp._mcp_server.request_context.session`) that have no public equivalent. Tests `test_dynamic_instructions.py` and `test_mcp_resources.py` pin the contract — re-run them on every minor bump.

## v0.8.12.7 (2026-04-13)

### Features
- **System prompt extraction**: the ~460-line hardcoded Computer Use system prompt has been moved from `computer_link_filter` into the orchestrator's `GET /system-prompt` endpoint (ported from the internal fork's v3.7/v3.8 architecture). The server now performs full substitution: `{file_base_url}`, `{archive_url}`, `{chat_id}` placeholders from an optional `chat_id` query param, and the `<available_skills>` XML block from an optional `user_email` query param. Per-user skill lookup falls back gracefully to `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_SKILLS` when no external skill provider is configured (community default).
- **Filter rewrite (v3.0.2 → v3.1.0)**: `openwebui/functions/computer_link_filter.py` is now a thin HTTP client — it fetches the fully-baked prompt from the server and injects it as-is. No more client-side URL substitution. File size dropped from 636 lines to under 250.
- **LRU cache with stale-cache fallback**: the filter keeps an `OrderedDict` LRU keyed by `chat_id`, 5-minute TTL, max 100 entries, O(1) eviction. On fetch failure (server down, timeout, non-200), it serves the stale entry for the same chat if present; otherwise it skips injection (same safe no-op path as the missing-`chat_id` case). No broken URLs ever reach the model.
- **New Valve `SYSTEM_PROMPT_URL`**: optional override for the endpoint URL (empty = derive from `FILE_SERVER_URL`).
- **Filter v3.1.0 → v3.2.0 — preview panel**: new Valves expose `/preview/{chat_id}` so the archive button can open the preview iframe on stock Open WebUI installs without the project's artifact patch.
- **Claude Code gateway compatibility** (fixes #40, PR #46): the orchestrator now passes `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and related gateway env vars through to the sandbox container; `sub_agent` model resolution widened to accept direct model IDs in addition to aliases. Docker Compose gets a gateway-overrides block and `.env.example` documents the full set.

### Fixes
- **Filter — cross-user prompt cache leak**: cache key now scoped so one user's baked prompt can't be served to another user; archive-button detection restricted to assistant messages and the current `chat_id` only.
- **Filter — URL scheme validation**: `/system-prompt` fetch now validates the URL scheme (http/https only) and narrows the exception surface so a misconfigured Valve can't SSRF or hang.
- **Filter — non-string system content**: `inlet()` no longer crashes when Open WebUI hands it a non-string system message.
- **sub-agent — delegation scope**: restricted to code-only tasks; stops wasting API calls on non-code delegations.

### Tests
- 5 new pinning tests in `tests/orchestrator/test_system_prompt_endpoint.py` cover the `/system-prompt` contract: `chat_id` substitution, `user_email` default-skills fallback, legacy `file_base_url` / `archive_url` params, no-param degraded path, `text/plain` content-type.
- 7 new cache tests in `tests/test_filter.py::SystemPromptFetchCache`: fresh fetch populates cache, cache hit within TTL skips HTTP, TTL expiry triggers refetch, LRU eviction at 100 entries, stale-cache fallback on server down, cold-cache skip when server down, `user_email` propagation to query string.
- The 7 pre-existing filter tests continue to pass. Two of them (which reach the injection path) now use a `setUp` fixture that mocks `urllib.request.urlopen`.
- `/system-prompt` endpoint test made hermetic (no reliance on ambient env).
- New `docker_manager` env-injection matrix tests and `sub_agent` model-resolution tests covering the Claude Code gateway path.

### CI
- **Sandbox smoke tests in build pipeline** (PR #48): the build workflow now boots the sandbox image and verifies Chromium launches end-to-end before accepting the image.

### Documentation
- `.env.example` now documents `MCP_TOKENS_URL` (optional external skill-provider URL; empty default → graceful fallback to `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_SKILLS`).
- New `docs/claude-code-gateway.md` guide cross-linked from README and INSTALL covering gateway configuration.
- FILE_SERVER_URL: two-setting behaviour documented (PR #58) so operators understand the server-side vs. filter-side URLs.
- sub-agent docs: explicit-override precedence clarified; cutoff wording unified; presentation examples pruned; non-code delegation policy aligned across the system prompt.

### Dependencies
- `playwright` repinned to `1.57.0` (briefly bumped to `1.59.1` then reverted in PR #47 to stay aligned with the base image).
- `psutil` 7.1.0 → 7.2.2.
- `beautifulsoup4` 4.14.2 → 4.14.3.
- `reportlab` 4.4.4 → 4.4.10.

### Privacy / packaging
- `.planning/` gitignored on the public GitHub remote; pre-push hook enforces the rule.
- Internal-fork references scrubbed; `tests/test-no-corporate.sh` extended to catch regressions.
- MCP Registry: added project logo, fixed `server.json` schema, simplified manifest for publication as `io.github.yambr/open-computer-use`.

### Code removed
- Filter's hardcoded ~460-line prompt f-string.
- Filter's client-side URL substitution (`{file_base_url}` / `{archive_url}` / `{chat_id}` replacement).
- Filter's timestamp-based file-injection heuristic (handled natively by Open WebUI middleware).
